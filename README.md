DATA ANALYTICS WITH PYTHON
Welcome to the world of data analytics with Python! In this file, you will find a collection of projects and resources that showcase the power and versatility of Python in data analysis.

Data Analysis starts from data discovery, then data structuring, data cleaning, data enrichment, data validation and publishing, all these can be achieved with python.  

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used in data analysis. It has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to perform complex data analysis tasks, such as data mining, data visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning.
In this file, you will find examples of Python code that demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis using Python. You'll find a diverse set of projects that cover a wide range of data analysis techniques, such as data cleaning, data exploration, data visualization, and statistical modeling. These projects showcase my ability to extract insights from data and present them in a clear and visually appealing way.

I hope you find this repository to be informative and engaging. I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications and experience further. Thank you for visiting my repository!

<b>Olympics Analysis</b> https://github.com/devtolu/PYTHON-PROJECTS/blob/main/olympics.ipynb <br>
<b>Description:</b>This project analyzes the paris olympic 2024 dataset, and classifies athletes into distinct teams and medals won. However, the data was firstly acquired, prepared for cleaning and anlysis and data visualization. The objective is derive insights and develop effective dashboard for carrying out decision making based on the business inteligence performed on the data for making informed decisions. As a result the data was acquired, prepared and cleaned before being analysed  

<b>Tools:</b> Jupyter Notebook (Python).

<b>Skills:</b> Python libraries (Pandas), def statement, data merging, nulls & duplicates handling. I did not perform subplot visualization hence i did not use matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

<b>Outputs:</b>
